    <h1>
        🥐 Croissant 🥐
    </h1>

    <p>It is a buttery, flaky, viennoiserie pastry inspired by the shape of the Austrian kipferl but using the French
        yeast-leavened laminated dough.
        <br />
        Croissants are named for their historical crescent shape. The dough is
        layered with
        butter, rolled and folded several times in succession, then rolled into a thin sheet, in a technique called
        laminating.
        The process results in a layered, flaky texture, similar to a puff pastry.
